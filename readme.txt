Makes WordPress upscale images and as a side effect: makes sure ALL images are cropped to the right dimensions.

== Description ==

This is basically a copy of the original image_resize_dimensions(), with a few tweaks to don't constrain the max destination size to the orginal size.

Please beware: This is not some kind of magic. Please understand the consequences.

== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the 'upscale-images' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Changelog ==

= Version 0.0.1 =
* It works (or at least it does for me)
