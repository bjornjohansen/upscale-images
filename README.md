upscale-images
==============

Makes WordPress upscale images and as a side effect: makes sure ALL images are cropped to the right dimensions.

This is basically a copy of the original image_resize_dimensions(), with a few tweaks to don't constrain the max destination size to the orginal size.

Please beware: This is not some kind of magic. Please understand the consequences.
